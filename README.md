# Advanced-Image-Processing-Pipeline
This is a comprehensive Python project that demonstrates an end-to-end image processing workflow. It features state-of-the-art techniques to grayscale, perform custom convolution filtering (including Gaussian smoothing), detect edges using the Sobel operator, and identify corners with the Harris Detector refined by NMS
